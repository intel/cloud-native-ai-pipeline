"""A Streambroker module.

This module provides an object-oriented design for stream broker client to connect with
stream broker server, publish frame to stream broker server.

Classes:
    StreamBrokerClientBase: An abstract base class for stream broker client.
    RedisStreamBrokerClient: A concrete class implementing the StreamBrokerClientBase
      for Redis server.
    KafkaStreamBrokerClient: A concrete class implementing the StreamBrokerClientBase
